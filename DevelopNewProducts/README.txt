Betting Analyzer

Betting analyzer is a very basic app to compute your potential profits and give you a also a possibility of success  

Obviously this is an app meant for fun :-)

 The formula

Suppose that we want to win 100$ by betting on 2 games .Then the decimal odd is 10 (10X10=100)  

In general:  
Decimal Odd= exponential ((log ( "desired earning" / "number of predictions "))*  

Next we connect Decimal odd  with the Win % (or Break Even %) with this formula:  

###Decimal odd:X+1 / Fractional odd:X /Break Even %:(100/X+1)%

Following is a table with some examples of conventions
Decimal	Fractional	Moneyline	Win%  Return
1.01	1/100	   -10,000	99.01%	1.00%
1.11	1/9			-900	90.00%	11.11%
1.33	1/3			-300	75.00%	33.33%
1.50	1/2			-200	66.67%	50.00%
2.00	1/1			+/-100	50.00%	100.00%
3.00	2/1			+200	33.33%	200.00%
